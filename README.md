This case study focuses on the statistical analysis of machine learning production data. 
I'm sharing it to demonstrate my ability to handle complex statistical concepts in a work environment and effectively communicate them to my team. 
While some contextual details are omitted in this repository, the primary goal is to highlight the potential traps and pitfalls when assessing the performance of different production pipelines.
The main presentation is available in the attached PDF file, and the supporting code can be found in the accompanying .ipynb file.
